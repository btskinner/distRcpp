[![Travis-CI Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/btskinner/distRcpp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/btskinner/distRcpp)

This package uses [Rcpp](http://www.rcpp.org) to quickly compute
population/distance-weighted measures. Geodesic distances can be
computed using either
[Haversine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula) or
[Vincenty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincenty%27s_formulae)
formulas. The package also has functions to return raw distance
measures. If you are able to [install Rcpp on your
machine](https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp), you should be able to
install this package and use these functions.

Install the latest development version from Github with

    devtools::install_github('btskinner/distRcpp')

**NB** This package is still in early beta stages. It does not have much
in the way of error handling. Data must be pre-processed so that no
missing (`NA`) values are given to the functions.

Available functions
-------------------

### Weighted measures

#### `dist_weighted_mean()`

Interpolate values for a vector of locations (**X**) that are the
inverse-distance-weighted average of measures taken at surrounding
locations (**Y**). For each point, *x*, nearby values of the measure
taken at **Y** are weighted more heavily than those from locations that
are farther away.

#### `popdist_weighted_mean()`

Interpolate values for a vector of locations (**X**) that are the
population/inverse-distance-weighted average of measures taken at
surrounding locations (**Y**). For each point, *x*, nearby values of the
measure taken at **Y** are weighted more heavily than those from
locations that are farther away. Measures taken in more heavily
populated *y* are given more weight than those with lower populations.
This weighting scheme is a compromise between distance and population
and is useful for interpolating measures that need to take both into
account.

### Distances

#### `dist_1to1()`

Compute and return the geodesic distance between two spatial points.
Returns distance in meters.

#### `dist_1tom()`

Compute and return the geodesic distance between one location and a
vector of other locations. Returns vector of distances in meters.

#### `dist_mtom()`

Compute and return the geodesic distance between each coordinate pair in
two vectors. Returns *n x k* matrix of distances in meters, where *n* =
\# of locations in first vector and *k* = \# of locations in second
vector.

#### `dist_df()`

Compute distance between corresponding coordinate pairs and return
vector of distances in meters. For use when creating a new `data.frame`
or [dplyr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dplyr) `tbl_df()` column.

#### `dist_min()`

Compute minimum distance between each starting point, *x*, and possible
end points, **Y**. Returns vector of minimum distances in meters that
equals \# of starting points (size of **X**).

Benchmark
---------

Compare speed with base R function when measuring the distance between
every United States population-weighted county centroid as measured in
2010 (N = 3,143 with complete measurements).
